# Group Project #1 | BuzzWordz

## Objectives

In this project, we worked together to create a book and cocktail pairing generator that matches the user's book genre and cocktail base selections to a randomly generated book and cocktail pairing for their entertainment, enjoyment, and consumption.

We utilized HTML and CSS to create the wireframes and the majority of the styling for our two pages. Javascript was used to run the two APIs in the background and push the results to the results page. We also used local storage to populate the user's previous results in a sidebar on the results page and save the user's login information.
